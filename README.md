Dear Fellow Dogizens,

The year is 2021 and in the latest who-has-bigger-balls contest between Elon and Jeff, it was a race to the moon. Earth’s most daring dogs were chosen. Tearfully they left their bitches behind. The race had begun.

Many spacecrafts were built by the greatest minds using public funds but as they crashed one by one before making it past the atmosphere, the human race who took part got rug pulled and many were unable to claim refunds on fake travel tickets. Only one Doge made it and established communication with a plea for help and reform.

Doge informed his species about the horrible life on the moon. It took endless hours to eat a doggy treat without gravity. Barking in tears day and night, to his rescue, came Bezos Doge. The bravest of all dogs carrying the bloodline of Doge and sponsored by the billions that Jeff’s ex-wife could not claim in court. As expected from Jeff, his blue spacecraft built by underpaid workers exploded during take off and the burning fuel scorched half of earth.

Realizing our planet needed a cure for communities to thrive, all species came together with established rules and a central currency used by everyone on earth named BEZOGE , honoring our dead canine astronaut. After the fairest initial distribution ever completed which put government stimulus plans to shame, the contract of the currency was burnt so it would never change and no one could control it.

Bezoge now starts its mission to revive earth and hopes to bring back Doge from the moon after it was abandoned and disowned by Elon publicly on a late night comedy show.
